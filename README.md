# OVERVIEW
Coq proof of the Euler product formula for the Riemann zeta function

    Σ (n ∈ ℕ*) 1/n^s = Π (p ∈ Primes) 1/(1-1/n^p)

Work in progress...

Some other proofs in prime numbers, not necessarily connected to
that proof:
- About the totient function φ
- About quadratic residues
- Lagrange's theorem of four squares
